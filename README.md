A smart and lean UI for your OpenHab Server (locally) using OpenHab REST API.

## Ideas

Use 'Labels' from Clarity!

## Setup

### OpenHab

add the line `org.eclipse.smarthome.cors:enable=true` in the file *services/runtime.cfg*

### Run locally

1. Install angular cli
2. cloe git repo (`git clone ....`)
3. run `npm i` in cloned folder
4. start app using `ng serve`

### Config

#### The **config.json** file is the main configuration of this App!

The OpenHab API URL must be configured as like `http://localhost:8080/rest`. Or whatever your host is.
> Don't forget to setup OpenHab like described above Setup -> OpenHab section.

There are three main sections in `config.json`:
#### Sections
##### dashboardTiles
Contains n _tile_ definitions. Each tile has a _title_ and n _items_ in it. 
Each _item_ is defined as:
```json
{
    "name": "<openhab item name>",
    "displayName": "<label in UI>",
    "category": "<category - see below>",
    "unit": "<item unit like Â°C, % etc.>", // optional
    "warningThreshold": 25, // optional: if set, state will be compared and set to isWarning
    "warningThresholdType": "gt" // optional: if warningThreshold is set, this should be also set to 'gt' (greater than) or 'lt' (lower than) to be able to determine warning state
}
```
##### rooms
Define `groupName` and `displayName` of groups you want to see on a separate page in the UI. 
One page for each room will be shown.

##### categories
tbd

#### Category
These are static categories defined for the UI itself since not every openhab item is configured the same and reporting the same via rest api.
Defined categories are found in enum _CategoryType_ `src/app/models/config/category.ts`.

My `config.json` is included and can be used as reference.
More detailled description of that file will follow!
